# Typing Speed Test

A Python application to measure typing speed in words per minute (WPM). This application allows users to test their typing speed by typing a predefined text, and it records the results, displaying the typing speed and the time taken. It also stores the results for tracking progress over time.

## Features

- **Typing Speed Measurement**: Measures how fast you can type a given text in words per minute.
- **Results Display**: Shows your typing speed (WPM) and the time taken to complete the test.
- **Result History**: Stores results to allow you to track your progress over time.
- **Simple UI**: A user-friendly interface built using Tkinter.
- **SQLite Database**: Stores results for easy tracking of your typing progress.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `virtualenv` for creating a virtual environment

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-speed-test.git
   cd typing-speed-test
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   Create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   Now, you can run the application:

   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

   This will start the typing speed test application.

## Usage

1. Open the application.
2. A predefined text will appear on the screen.
3. Start typing the text as quickly and accurately as possible.
4. The application will calculate your typing speed (in WPM) and display the result.
5. Your result will be saved to the SQLite database, and you can track your progress over time.

## Requirements

- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the GUI (comes pre-installed with Python).
- **SQLite3**: Used for storing user results (comes pre-installed with Python).
- **Flask** (optional): If you plan to extend the project to a web version, you can install and use Flask.
